<p>Now 10 years old, the studio has a lot of history
and success in its trail. At 70 years old, Masao Maruyama
decided to found a new animation studio in the hopes of
producing <i>In This COrner of the World</i> due to financial difficulties
at his previous studio, Madhouse. Despite that, the film wasn't released until 5 years later. 
With all the success comes scruntiny. The studio has been accused of overworking its employees and 
animators, which is most likely true due to the cultrue that comes with anime and the huge productions that the studio has made. 
Through all this, MAPPA is still one of the most successful animation studios in the world today.
